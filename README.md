# Project Overview

## Project Name

Find.(IT) Book Store

## Project Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.

<b><i>My project will invoke a book store API that returns Computer Science books with relevant prices, authors, book title and many more attributes.<i> <b>

## API and Data Sample

Specify the API you are using and include a link. Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your API so we know you can access it and get the info you need


<i>The API I will be using is api.itbook.store<i>

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Use IT bookstore API to help users find relevant and useful Computer Scince books 
- Render books on page with relevant information, such as title and price
- Render search results as the user types into a search bar
- As the page is loaded with books, the user can click each individual book to find out more information about it
- CSS styling and flex box to allow for responsive design
- Media queries for responsiveness on smaller screen resolutions

#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Add second API that compares book prices with other sites
- Use local storage to save user favorite books searched
- share books with friends with a share button
- add CSS animations for when user is searching for a book, a loading text appears

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|August 28-29| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete
|August 30| Project Approval | Incomplete
|August 31| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|September 1| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|September 2| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|September 3| MVP | Incomplete
|September 4| Presentations | Incomplete

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Planning workflow | L | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working w/ HTML | L | 2hrs| 1.5hrs | 2hrs |

| CSS styling | L | 2hrs| 3.5hrs | |
| JS Code first call | H | 3hrs| 2hrs | 3hrs |
| JS Code second call | H | 3hrs| 1hrs | 1hrs |
